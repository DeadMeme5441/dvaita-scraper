# src/tasks/__init__.py

# This file makes src/tasks a Python package.
# We can import the tasks here to make them easily accessible if needed,
# but ARQ's WorkerSettings usually references the modules directly.

# from .discovery import discover_initial_books, fetch_book_details
# from .processing import process_book
